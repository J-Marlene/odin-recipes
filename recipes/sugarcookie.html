    <h1>Soft Sugar Cookies</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> 1 cup salted butter</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li> 1 large egg</li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup granulated sugar <em>for rolling cookies</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 375F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li> In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li> Place butter and sugar in large mixing bowl. Mix on medium-high speed until light in color and fluffy, about 3 mins.</li>
        <li> Add egg and vanilla and mix on low for about 30 seconds or until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li> Slowly add in dry ingredients, be careful not to over mix.</li>
        <li> Scoop the dough into large balls, roll the ball in the sugar. </li>
        <li> Place balls on your lined baking sheets. Bake for 12-13 mins. Cookies are done when the edges are a light golden brown and there is some crackling along the top. Do not over bake as the cookies will not be as chewy.</li>
        <li> Cool for 5 mins on the baking sheet. Transfer cookies carefully to the cooling rack to finish cooling. Cookies stay fresh for up to one week. (If they last that long)</li>

    </ol>
