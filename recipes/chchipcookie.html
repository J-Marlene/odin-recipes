    <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon fine sea salt </li>
        <li> 2 sticks (227g) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li> 1\2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
        <li> 2 large eggs (at room temperature)</li>
        <li> 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 350 F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper</li>
        <li> In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li> In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter, white sugar and brown sugar until creamy. Scrape down sides and bottom of mixing bowl. Add the vanilla and eggs and beat until combined. Gradually beat in the flour mixer. Stir in chocolate chips</li>
        <li> If time permits, wrap dough in plastic wrap and cool in fridge for at least 24 hrs. This makes for thicker, chewier and more flavorful cookies. Let dough come to room temperature just until soft enough to scoop.</li>
        <li> Scoop into tablespoon sized balls and drop onto parchment lined baking sheets.</li>
        <li> Bake for 11-13 mins or until golden brown in color. Cool on pan for 5 mins, remove to wire rack.</li>
        <li> These cookies can be stored in air tight container for up to 3 days. (If they last that long)</li>
    </ol>
